### Welcome to my GitHub profile!ðŸ’»

#### What are we gonna find on this account?
This is my account for uploading code, which I created to learn new things. For example if I decided I would like to learn a new programming language I'm doing this by created a TicTacToe with it.

#### Why do I always create a tictactoe to learn something new?
At the university, my prof told me - the best way to learn a new language is, by creating anything you already know the concept of how you would do it. So I stuck with tictactoe, since this was my first code I ever wrote (since I seriosly try to learn how to code..)

#### Thanks you for looking at my code!
Thank you for looking at my code. Even if it won't be the best you have ever seen, I think it is still not the worst. 
You can only learn from mistakes. This is my goal. I just try to code and find improvements I might do different the next time.
The hardest part is to get into coding at all. As soon as you made your first steps you will find stuff to improve. 

#### Code isn't perfect.
As I already mentioned. Learning to code isn't super clean all the time. I will make mistakes but I will try to imrpove. In my opinion, when you want to code something, after you've done it your always smarter and think you should've done it differently. But thats coding. Keep up, take this new information with you for future projects and try to improve.
